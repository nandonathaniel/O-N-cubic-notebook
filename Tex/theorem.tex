\textbf{Pythagorean Triples}

Integer solutions of $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$. All relatively prime triples are given by: $x = 2mn, y = m^2 - n^2, z = m^2 + n^2$, where $m > n$, $gcd(m, n) = 1$, and $m != n \pmod{2}$.

\textbf{Kirchoff Matrix Theorem}

Let matrix $T = [t_{ij}]$, where $t_{ij}$ is the number of multiedges between $i$ and $j$, for $i \neq j$, and $t_{ii} = -deg[i]$. Number of spanning trees of a graph is equal to the determinant of a matrix obtained by deleting any k-th row and column from $T$.
